# VisceralFatValidation
This program will take in MRI images in the NIFTI format and display them on the screen. The user will draw a closed contour around specified areas of fat at multiple axial slices. These results are saved in a file to be validated with the VisceralFatSegmentation program. This program is created using Qt and C++.
